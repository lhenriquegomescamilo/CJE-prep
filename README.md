CJE Prep
===============

This repository was made to create and configure a Vagrant Virtual Machine with a Tomcat/Jenkins instance with the required plugins for the Certified Jenkins Engineer Test (2016 edition). 

Something I should add: This project will probably be upgraded to create and configure a jenkins instance with some example projects. After I take the test (August), I'll probably transform this in a production-ready Jenkins (remove/add plugins for a more realistic production enviroment)
